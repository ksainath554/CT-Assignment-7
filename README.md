ML Model Deployment with Streanlit
Project Overview
  This project demonstartes the deployment of a machine learning model as an interactive web     application using Sreamlit. The application allows users to input data, receive real-time prediction from a trained model, and visualize the model's decision-making process. This serves as a practical example of making machine learning models accessible and interactive for non-technical users.

Features-:
  1) Interactive Input: Users can adjust input features using sliders.
  2) Real-time Predictions: Get instant predictions based on the input data.
  3) Model Visulization: A scatter plot displays the synthetic training data, the model's decision boundary, and the user's input point, helping to interpret the prediction.
  4) responsive UI: Built with Streamlit, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface.
  5) Dummy Model Training: A simple Logistic Regression model is trained on synthetic data during application startup

Technologies used-:
  1) Python 3.x
  2) Sreamlit: For building the interactive web application.
  3) Pandas: For numerical manipulation.
  4) Numpy: For numerical operations.
  5) Scikit-learn: For machine learning model training and data generation.
  6) Seaborn: For enhanced data visulization.
